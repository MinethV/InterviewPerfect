Here you can find the dataset for Confidence Level Estimation of Indian Candidates.

Data: You can find 4,754 frame images of candidates extracted from videos recorded during Interviews

Root is the main folder that further contains two folders :-
1. candidate_frames:
	Candidate Frames contain images of candidates captured during interview under various environmental and behavioural conditions.

2. labeled_dataset:
	We have labeled the collected visual data based on the features Facial Expression, Face Direction and Eye Movement. As per the research and survey conducted before labeling maxinmum weightage has been given to facial expression parameter as it plays more vital role while judging the confidence of any person, equal weightage has been given to the remaining eye movement and face direction parameters. CSV files containing the labeled data for first 200 frames is provided for each candidate.If the person is confident, label is 1 and 0 otherwise.

Given files contain some missing data as well, reasons for missing data are failure to capture frames by machine learning model, data unavailability, processing errors, failure during feature extraction.
