<h1> INTERVIEW PERFECT </h1>


<p> Job interview is one of the most important events during any hiring process because it gives both seekers and employers an opportunity to decide wisely whether to choose this candidate or not. Nonetheless, interviewing itself often induces stress which, in turn, may prevent one of the best candidates from giving a good presentation. In this regard, it becomes very tough for the graduates and interns because most of them are lacking the actual fieldwork experiences in an interview environment. 
  
In order to overcome this challenge, we propose a new interview simulator with facial expression and voice recognition system. This latest technology will create a practical and virtual reality setting where job applicants ranging from rookies to professionals can sharpen their interview skills while receiving personalised assistance to build the much needed self-confidence for passing live job interviews.

At present, the field of interview preparation has been restricted to conventional approaches that include both practice interviews and internet websites. The problem is that most of these methods lack in giving such personalised feedback and a realistic approach to practising the process of interviewing. Therefore, many potential employees do not know how to market themselves effectively in an interview, thus leading to wasted chances and stagnation in their careers. 

These limitations will be addressed in our interview simulator, which presents a holistic and tailored approach towards interview training. The candidateâ€™s nonverbal and verbal communication will be analysed by the simulation using sophisticated facial expression and voice recognition technologies. The analysis will evaluate aspects such as eye contact, face direction, facial expressions, Use of filler words. 

These specific comments would help them note aspects that could be improved in their next interviews, and thus they would make suitable amendments on the same. Candidates will also be able to test their skill of giving standard interview responses as if they are sitting with an actual interviewer in a simulated environment. </p>
